title:  "Manila: Ganesha NFS on CephFS"
description: The Shared File System service (manila) supports mounting shared file systems backed by a Ceph File System (CephFS) via the NFSv4 protocol. NFS-Ganesha servers operating on Controller nodes are used to export CephFS to tenants with High Availability (HA). Tenants are isolated from one another and may only access CephFS through the provided NFS gateway interface.

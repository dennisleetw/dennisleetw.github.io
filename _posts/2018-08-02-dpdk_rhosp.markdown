title:  "OVS-DPDK"
description: Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) consists of a set of libraries and user-space drivers for fast packet processing. Itâ€™s designed to run mostly in user-space enabling applications to perform their own packet processing operations directly from/to the NIC. This results in delivering up to wire speed performance for certain use cases depending on the processing depth by reducing some of the bulk. This article describes how to deploy DPDK node in RHOSPv13 using TripleO.
